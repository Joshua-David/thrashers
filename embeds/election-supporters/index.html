    <div class="election-supporters__quote-body">Since the shock of the EU referendum last year I have become so much more interested in politics again and I feel your articles are exceptionally well written and give people like me a voice. A beacon of open and true journalism in this country which I love but which has gone mad. After reading the Guardian daily it felt right to become a supporter</div>

    <div class="election-supporters__quote-body">Since the US election, I&rsquo;ve read the Guardian almost every day, trying to understand the catastrophe that has befallen our country and to learn about the many ways the resistance is helping to keep the US a democracy. The Guardian is fair and balanced reporting</div>

I&rsquo;m both worried for our future as a human community and angry against people who exploit the ignorance of their fellow citizens. I read newspapers online a lot, for free. Now is the time to give what I can to the organizations and collectives that can be a counterpower to the rising hatred. I think the Guardian&rsquo;s journalists are a part of it and I&rsquo;m proud to make my small contribution to your mission</div>

    <div class="election-supporters__quote-body">As a concerned (deeply worried!) citizen of the world, I really appreciate the Guardian&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to independent journalism and especially to keeping climate change in the news. I am also deeply concerned about the erosion of viable funding models for quality investigative journalism and analysis, and all the talk about the &ldquo;post-truth era&rdquo; following the US election was the last straw. Honestly, I regret that it took me this long to put my money where my mouth is</div>

    <div class="election-supporters__quote-body">I don&rsquo;t want there ever to be a situation where we have a completely right wing press with everything paywalled.

    <div class="election-supporters__quote-body">I have been reading a number of Guardian articles over the last few years and increasingly so during the EU referendum and US election season, which I believe are incredibly important to keeping the spotlight on big businesses and government. There is a serious lack of proper investigative journalism in Australia – most are tainted by commercial interests or the Murdoch press</div>

    <div class="election-supporters__quote-body">I wanted to find out news about the French presidential election and there was no question where I would look. I had been thinking about long-term support for a while now, since I enjoy quite a few Guardian podcasts regularly. After logging in, something I don&rsquo;t usually do, I saw with astonishment that I registered 10 years ago, almost to the day. That made up my mind</div>
